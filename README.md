# C# CH347-USB-I2C-SPI-UART
2024/01/05 updated the sample code with Device Inforamtion like VID/PID shown in UI after device open.
The Visual C# 2022 sample code of CH347T USB bridge
Code for interfacing I2C, SPI and UART.
I2C was testted work 400KHz, SPI 60MHz and UART 7.5MHz.
Some are tested ok and some are not. 
Take it as reference on your own risk if you need.

The struct portion for Device Information has never work and if would be appreciated if anybody tells how to make it work.
Thanks.
